# Overview
> **Note:** This tutorial walks through how to build a payment application by using the Swift Wallet SDK. It mainly uses the [`swift_wallet_sdk`](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/building-apps/wallet/overview).
In some cases it also uses the core [`stellar-ios-mac-sdk`](https://github.com/Soneso/stellar-ios-mac-sdk).

We'll walk through the steps as we build a sample application we've called [Swift Basic Pay](https://github.com/Soneso/SwiftBasicPay), which will be used to showcase various features of the Stellar Swift Wallet SDK.

## Installation

Clone the [Swift Basic Pay](https://github.com/Soneso/SwiftBasicPay) repository, and start the app.
